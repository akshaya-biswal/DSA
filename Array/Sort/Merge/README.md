# Merge sort

- Merge Sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.

- Here, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved individually. Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

- Space complexity : O(n)

- Case Complexity : O(n\*log n)
