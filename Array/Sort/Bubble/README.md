## Optimized Bubble Sort:

- Bubble sort always runs O(N2) time even if the array is sorted. It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if the inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap.
- We can introduce an extra variable swapped. The value of swapped is set true if there occurs swapping of elements. Otherwise, it is set false.
