# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Note: You might have played the game Treasure Hunt, where each clue includes the information about the next clue. That is how the linked list operates.

- Traversal : access each element
- Insertion : adds a new element
- Deletion : removes the existing elements
- Search : find a node
- Sort : sort the nodes
