# Tree Traversal

Traversing a tree means visiting every node in the tree. If we, want to add all the values in the tree or find the largest one. For all these operations, we need to visit each node of the tree.

Depending on the order, there can be three types of traversal.

#### Inorder traversal

- First, visit all the nodes in the left subtree
- Then the root node
- Visit all the nodes in the right subtree

#### Preorder traversal

- Visit root node
- Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
- Visit all the nodes in the right subtree

#### Postorder traversal

- Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
- Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
- Visit the root node
